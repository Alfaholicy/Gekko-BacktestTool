Tool for Gekko trading bot. The tool performs a test with multiple pairs and/or multiple strategies on a single run. Suppose you have a strategy that you want to test on more currency pairs. You enter all the pairs on which you want to test the strategy for the application configuration. You start the application and everything happens automatically. You are just waiting for the results that appear on the screen. You will see how your strategy falls on other pairs, where it works the best, and where the worst. More detailed data is available in the .CSV file, which you can open in a spreadsheet or text editor.

You can do the same with many strategies and CandleSize values. You can test all your strategies on eg BTC-USD pair and compare results, which will allow you to choose the best strategy you will use in live trade.
